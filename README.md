# MWebsite

This project represents my very first front-end website development experience. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and **Chart.js**, it was created during my internship at the Premier Research Institute of Science and Mathematics. Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with front-end technologies and worked on bringing a functional and aesthetically pleasing website to life.

## Key Features:
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to work seamlessly on various devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript and Chart.js are used to add dynamic interactions and functionality, including data visualization.
- **Chart.js Integration**: Includes visually engaging charts to represent data in a clear and interactive manner.
- **Clean and Simple Layout**: The website emphasizes a user-friendly design with easy navigation.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling the website, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and dynamic elements to the site.
- **Chart.js**: A JavaScript library used for creating interactive and responsive charts.

## Purpose of the Project:
This project was part of my internship at Premier Research Institute of Science and Mathematics, where I applied my front-end development skills in a real-world scenario. It was an invaluable learning experience that helped me improve my technical abilities and understand how to build websites that are both functional and user-friendly.
